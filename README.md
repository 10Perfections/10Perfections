## Why the name '10Perfections'?
It is named after the "Ten Perfections of the Theravadin Buddhist Tradition". Ideals which I attempt to hold myself accountable to, so that I may be a better human.

In the Pāli Canon, the Buddhavaṃsa of the Khuddaka Nikāya lists the ten perfections (dasa pāramiyo) as:
1.	Dāna pāramī: generosity, giving of oneself
2.	Sīla pāramī: virtue, morality, proper conduct
3.	Nekkhamma pāramī: renunciation
4.	Paññā pāramī: wisdom, discernment
5.	Viriya pāramī: energy, diligence, vigour, effort
6.	Khanti pāramī: patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance
7.	Sacca pāramī: truthfulness, honesty
8.	Adhiṭṭhāna pāramī : determination, resolution
9.	Mettā pāramī: goodwill, friendliness, loving-kindness
10.	Upekkhā pāramī: equanimity, serenity
